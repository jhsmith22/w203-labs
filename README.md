This repository contains 2 lab reports I contributed to as part of a master-level course: Statistics for Data Science (W203) at the University of California Berkeley.

**Lab 1 Group Members and My Contribution**: Jessica Stockham (me), Heaven Klair, Josie Ruggieri. In this group project, I did nearly all the coding and report writing. I wrote code to clean the data and conduct the statistical tests. Other group members contributed visualizations and brainstorming. 

**Lab 2 Group Members and My Contribution**: Jessica Stockham (me), Derrick Chan-Sew, Jammy Chan (Chi Hung). In this group project, I authored the final report, including a detailed discussions and limitations section. I also wrote code to clean/prepare predictive features and test the statistical assumptions in our model. Other group members wrote the code to extract the data, store necessary variables, perform exploratory data analysis, and run the linear regression models. We also produced both a slide presentation with our results.
# Lab 1 Abstract
Just like the COVID-19, the US 2020 elections raised unprecedented challenges for its citizens. While the
nation was still recovering from the pandemic, the Americans, amongst the turmoil, stood up to cast their
vote and fulfill the needs to democracy. Access to voting, a discussion rooted in our countries’ racist history,
was once again a heated political topic. In particular, Democrat commentators argued that Republicans used
a variety of tactics to make it more difficult for likely Democrat voters to actually submit their ballots. For
example, there are allegations of limited voting hours, fewer voting locations, staffing issues that lead to long
lines, and sparse drop-boxes for absentee ballot drops. If such speculation is true, we should be concerned
about the integrity of our elections. As a first step, this statistical analysis looks to nationally representative
survey data to gain insight from voters themselves on the situation on the ground in the 2020 election to
answer the question of interest:

**Did Democrat-leaning or Republican-leaning voters claim to have more difficulty voting in the
2020 election?**

We utilize data from the 2020 American National Election Studies (ANES), which surveyed a nationallyrepresentative set of respondents before (Aug 18, 2020 - Nov 3, 2020) and after the 2020 national election that
occurred on Nov 8, 2020 (Nov 8, 2020 - Jan 4, 2021). It was a survey of non-institutionalized U.S. citizens
age 18 and older.


# Lab 2 Abstract
Real estate prices have seen a recent surge in pricing in an increasingly competitive market. While there is
transparency around overall market value, many homeowners are concerned about the factors that will have a
direct effect on the value of their homes. These factors are pivotal in the home buying process and ultimately
create long term value for homeowners. Many communities have homeowners associations (HOAs) which
present increasing annual costs for homeowners due to inflation. While the homeowners associations are
essential in managing common property and providing services to residents, one of their principal functions
is to protect property values. Our research focus is how the price of HOAs affect overall property value.

Government officials who derive property taxes based on a home’s assessed value, HOA community leaders
and the homeowners have equal interest in an empirical analysis in the effect of HOA prices and home value.
Homeowners in the community, most likely a subgroup such as the HOA Committee or Board of Directors
can define the rate of increase of HOA fees and potential affect home prices. HOA takes care of all common
areas, using dues collected from residents to repair, maintain, or replace community amenities and it does
affect property value over time. This research creates and evaluates a set of regression models then uses
the selected model to estimate home value from HOA paid for a property.
